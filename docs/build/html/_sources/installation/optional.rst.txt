Optional Dependencies
======================

.. _matlab_setup:

MATLAB
-------
**Required by:** :ref:`headreco_docs` head segmentation pipeline

For :ref:`headreco_docs`, MATLAB needs to be configured such that typing :code:`matlab` on a terminal window will start it.

This is already the case in most Windows installations. However, on Linux and MacOSX you might need to create a link to the :code:`matlab` executable somewhere in your system :code:`$PATH`. This can be done with the commands

* Linux

  .. code-block:: bash
  
     sudo ln -s /usr/local/MATLAB/R<VERSION>/bin/matlab /usr/local/bin/matlab
  
  \

* MacOSX

  .. code-block:: bash
  
     sudo ln -s /Applications/MATLAB_R<VERSION>.app/bin/matlab /usr/local/bin/matlab
  
  \

If MATLAB is not installed in the default location, you can find out where it is installed by typing in a MATLAB terminal

.. code-block:: matlab

   matlabroot


SimNIBS also has a MATLAB API, available in the :file:`matlab/` subfolder of the SimNIBS installation directory.

FSL
----
**Required by:** :ref:`mri2mesh_docs` head segmentation pipeline and :ref:`dwi2cond_docs` conductivity tensor reconstruction pipeline

1. Follow the instructions on `this link <http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FslInstallation>`_

2. Add

.. code-block:: bash

   source /etc/fsl/5.0/fsl.sh

\
  in the end of the :file:`~/.bashrc` (Linux) or :file:`~/.bash_profile` (MacOSX) file (assuming that fsl is installed as usually into :file:`/etc/fsl/5.0`).


FreeSurfer
----------
**Required by:** :ref:`mri2mesh_docs` head segmentation pipeline

1. Follow the instructions `here <http://freesurfer.net/fswiki/DownloadAndInstall>`_

2. Make sure that you have a registration file, and set the path in the :file:`~/.bashrc` (Linux) or :file:`~/.bash_profile` (MacOS).
