* Antivirus software and other security features might interfere with the installation.

* Often times, :ref:`installing with the conda package manager <conda-install>` can help overcome problems with the installer. Please try it out

* **glError** messages when opening the GUI can often be solved by updating video drivers.

* If you are stuck, please :ref:`contact us <contact>` and attach the :file:`simnibs_install_log.txt` file, which can be found in your SimNIBS installation directory
