Setting up and Running Simulations
===================================

This tutorial is based on the :ref:`Example Dataset <dataset>`.
Please download it before continuing

Starting the GUI and selecting a Head Model
--------------------------------------------
1. Launch the Graphical User Interface (GUI) from the Start Menu or by typing on a terminal window

  .. code-block:: bash
  
     simnibs_gui
  
  \

  A window such as the following should appear

.. image:: ../images/tutorial_emptygui.png
   :align: center

2. Click on the *Browse* button next to the *Head Mesh* box

.. image:: ../images/tutorial_bowse.png
   :align: center

3. Navigate to the example dataset folder and select the :file:`ernie.msh` file, in the
   example data set

.. image:: ../images/tutorial_selectmsh.png
   :align: center

4. The head mesh will be loaded and the **m2m Folder** and **Output Folder** boxes filled

.. image:: ../images/tutorial_guihead.png
   :align: center

\
  You can change the **Output Folder** by clicking on the *Browse* button close to it, and visualize the gray matter surface by clicking on the *Gray Matter* button above the head model. 


Setting up a tDCS Simulation
-----------------------------
1. Click on *Add tDCS Poslist* at the bottom left of the window

.. image:: ../images/tutorial_addtdcs.png
   :align: center

\
  A new tab will show up.

2. Click on *Add Electrode*

.. image:: ../images/tutorial_addelectrode.png
   :align: center

\
  A new row will be shown in the table

3. Click twice in the *Shape* cell

.. image:: ../images/tutorial_shapecell.png
   :align: center

\
  A new window will open where you can configure the electrode size and shape.

4. Let’s suppose we have a :math:`7.0 \times 5.5 \text{cm}^2` electrode, composed of a single gel layer of 5 mm thickness

.. image:: ../images/tutorial_electrodegui.png
   :align: center

\
  Please refer to the :ref:`GUI documentation <gui_docs>` for a more detailed explanation of this window. You can also copy/paste electrode definitions by right clicking in the shape cell

5. Now double click in the *Position* cell. A new window will appear. You can either select an EEG position from the drop-down menu in the left or click twice in the model to get a position.

.. image:: ../images/tutorial_position1.png
   :align: center

\

6. Choose the C3 electrode from the drop-down menu. A black sphere appears in the electrode position, with a green axis indicating the electrode's “y” axis

.. image:: ../images/tutorial_position2.png
   :align: center

\


7. Select the electrode *current* in the first column of the electrode tables. **Positive** values designate **anodes**, and **negative** values **cathodes**. The sum of all current values has to be zero.

.. image:: ../images/tutorial_elcurrent.png
   :align: center

\

8. Now add a second electrode, place it at AF4 and double click on a nearby position to rotate it, aligning the green axis with the top/down direction.

.. image:: ../images/tutorial_position3.png
   :align: center

\
  Select a shape and a current of :math:`-1.000 \text{mA}` for this second electrode.
  You can see a simple preview of the electrode shapes by clicking on *Preview Shapes* at the bottom of the screen

Setting up a TMS Simulation
----------------------------
1. Click on *Add TMS Poslist* in the bottom of the window. A new TMS tab will be created

.. image:: ../images/tutorial_addtms.png
   :align: center

\
2. Click on *Browse* and select the *Magstim_70mm_Fig8.nii.gz* coil file

.. image:: ../images/tutorial_addcoil.png
   :align: center

\
3. Click on *Add Position*

.. image:: ../images/tutorial_addposition.png
   :align: center

\
4. Double click in the *Position* cell

.. image:: ../images/tutorial_positioncell.png
   :align: center

\
5. You can select the coil position the same way as an electrode position, or alternatively by double clicking in the head model. In the TMS case, the Y axis where the coil is pointing. Here, we will click on the *Gray Matter* button above the model window and place the coil above the motor cortex, with the green axis pointing anteriorly. This means that the coil handle points posteriorly. :download:`See here for more information on coil coordinates <../data/coil_axesorientation.pdf>` 

.. image:: ../images/tutorial_coilpos.png
   :align: center

\

6. Additionally, you can also set the dI/dt (the current change ratio) and the coil-skin distance.

7. When using a *.nii.gz* coil file, click on *Show dA/dt field* to see the norm of the primary electric field.

.. image:: ../images/tutorial_dadt.png
   :align: center


\

.. attention:: This is **NOT the electric field**, but it can be interpreted as a very smooth approximation of it.

Setting Simulation Options
---------------------------
1. Go to *Edit* → *Simulation Options*

.. image:: ../images/tutorial_simoptions.png
   :align: center


\
  The following window will appear

.. image:: ../images/tutorial_simoptions2.png
   :align: center

\

2. We can select the *fields* to be output from the simulation


  * **v**:
      Electrical Potential (Voltage). Units: Volts
  * **vector E**:
      Electric field vector. Units: V/m
  * **norm E**:
      Norm (or strength) of the electric field. Units: V/m
  * **vector J**:
      Current density vector. Units: A/mm²
  * **norm J**:
      Norm of the current density. Units: A/mm²
  * **Conductivities**:
      Conductivity field. For isotropic conductivities, this is a scalar.
      For anisotropic conductivities, this is the largest eigenvector of the conductivity tensor.
      Units: S/m
  * **dA/dt**:
      Primary field caused by the coil. TMS only. This is a vector field. Units: V/m

   Select **vector E** and **norm E**.

.. _tutorial_aditional_options:

3. And the  *Additional Options*

  * **Open in Gmsh**:
      Opens the simulation results in *Gmsh*
  * **Interpolate to cortical surface**:
      Interpolates the fields along a surface at the center of the gray matter sheet. Not available for :ref:`headreco_docs` models ran with :code:`--no-cat`.
  * **Transform to fsaverage space**:
      Interpolates to the middle of gray matter and transforms it to FsAverage space. Not available for :ref:`headreco_docs` models ran with :code:`--no-cat`.
  * **Interpolate to a nifiti volume**:
      Interpolates the fields to a nifti volume.
  * **Transform to MNI space**:
      Interpolates the fields to a nifti volume and applies a transformation to MNI space.

  For the example run, we will select all of the above.


Running a Simulation
---------------------
1. Click on Run at the bottom of the screen

.. image:: ../images/tutorial_runsim.png
   :align: center

\
2. If there are no errors in the problem set-up, a new window will appear and show the simulation progress. The simulation takes a few minutes, and when finished a Gmsh window opens with the simulation results.

Now, please go on to our tutorial on :ref:`visualization_tutorial`.

Output Files
-------------

After the simulation is finished, the :file:`simnibs_simulation` directory will look like the following

.. image:: ../images/tutorial_output_files.png
   :align: center

\

The main files here are the :file:`.msh` files

  * :file:`ernie_TDCS_1_scalar.msh`
      With results of the tDCS simulation
  * :file:`ernie_TMS_2-0001_Magstim_70mm_Fig8_nii_scalar.msh`
      With results of the TMS simulation

The folders
   * :file:`fsavg_overlays`
   * :file:`mni_volumes`
   * :file:`subject_overlays`
   * :file:`subject_volumes`

Are only present if the corresponding :ref:`options <tutorial_aditional_options>` are
selected.
