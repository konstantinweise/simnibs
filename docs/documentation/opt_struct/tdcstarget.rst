TDCStarget
===========


Initialization
---------------

* **Python**

  .. code-block:: python

     from simnibs import optimization
     opt = optimization.TDCSoptimize()
     target = opt.add_target()



  \

* **MATLAB**

  .. code-block:: matlab

     opt = opt_struct('TDCSoptimize');
     opt.target(1)

  \ 


Attributes
-----------

.. _positions_attribute_doc:

* **positions**: *Nx3 list/array of floats (Python/MATLAB)*

  * **Desctiption**: Positions where the field is to be optimized. The positions
    are in **world coordinates** in **subject space** (:ref:`see here or more information about
    coordinates in SimNIBS <coords_doc>`). SimNIBS finds the position in the
    mesh closest to the input position. These can be obtained by

      * Open the :file:`tdcs_leadfield/{subID}_ROI.msh` file in *gmsh*, click in
        *Mesh* -> *Inspect* and click in the model
      * Open the :file:`m2m_{subID}/T1fs_conform.nii.gz` file in a NifTi reader and
        record the **world coordinates**.

* **directions**: *'normal' or Nx3 list/array of floats (Python/MATLAB), optional*

  * **Description**: Direction of the field to be optimized. If set to
    **normal** and the **leadfield** was run with **map_to_surf** set to *True*, will optimize the normal direction (see :ref:`tdcsleadfield_doc`).

  * **Defaut**: *'normal*

  .. note:: This argument is required if the leadfield obtained with :code:`map_to_surf = False`, which is the default in :ref:`tdcsleadfield_doc`


.. _indexes_attribute_doc:

* **indexes**: *Nx1 list/array of ints (Python/MATLAB), optional*

  * **Description**: As an alternative to **positions**, you can select the **node**
    index (if the leadfield was run with :code:`map_to_surf = True`, see :ref:`tdcsleadfield_doc`) or the **element** index
    (if the leadfield was run with :code:`map_to_surf = False`, see :ref:`tdcsleadfield_doc`)

  * **Default**: Get the points closest to the **positions**.


* **intensity**: *float, optional*

  * **Description**: Intensity of the field (*E* or *J*, see :ref:`tdcsleadfield_doc`) to
    be reached on average on the target and along the given direction. To optimize for
    intensity at the target rather than focality, you can set this value to a large
    number (eg: 100). With negative values, the direction will be inversed.
  * **Defaut**: 0.2


* **max_angle**: *float, optinal*

  * **Description**: Maximum angle between field and target direction.
  * **Default**: No maximum

  .. note:: This condition is only fulfilled in the mean across the target region, and not point-wise. Does not work in multi-target optimization.


\

.. _radius_attribute_doc:

* **radius**: *float, optional*

 * **Description**: All points in the radius around the specified position/index to be added to the target area, in
   mm. Set to 0 if you want the target to be only the specified positions or indices.
 * **Default**: 2

* **tissues**: *list/array of ints (Python/MATLAB), optional*

  * **Descrption**: List of tissue indices where the target is defined. Leave empty if all tissues in the leadfield. This allows you to prevent that nearby tissue regions are included in the target (e.g. white matter or CSF bordering a target in GM , assuming that all three tissues were included in the leadfield).
  * **Default**: All tissues
